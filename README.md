# Module_10_UnsupervisedLearning_challenge_answer
I’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. 
Competitors are fierce, so I want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. 
Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, I want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for my portfolio.

When I present the idea, your manager will love it! So, i was asked to create a prototype for submitting my crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.
